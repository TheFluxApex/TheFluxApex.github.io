## Site Mission
For many years in the online community in both gaming and tech I&#39;ve been known as <span style="color: yellow;">&#39;Lateralus138&#39;</span>&#46; I have recently started changing my UN/IGN to <span style="color: yellow">&#39;TheFluxApex&#39;</span> and since I have tons of content as my old name I have created this site to help connect the new me to the old me&#46;
## Motivation
I have had the same online name for many years and it&#39;s time for a change&#46;
## Goals
1. I&#39;m in the process of changing my name on many sites. This is time consuming and not always possible so I plan to make this site the connection between everything I have done and am still doing&#46;
2. I&#39;ll be continously updating this site with content until all connections have been made&#46;
